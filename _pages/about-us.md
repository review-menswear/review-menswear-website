<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>Established in the Fall of 1989, Review is one of Stocktonâ€™s oldest independent stores, starting off solely selling fashion clothing from leading European designers. A couple of years later we moved into mens formal hire, whilst retaining our fashion element. This was met with immediate success and by 1992 Review were voted number one national wedding outfitters by the MFHS.</p>

<p>We now have over 2000 weddings under our belt, so a groom and his party can be confident every little detail is taken care of by our experienced and well trained staff.</p>

<p>Review offers a spacious, fresh and modern environment with a cool retro vibe. We are acclaimed for turning out the best dressed grooms in Teesside.</p>
